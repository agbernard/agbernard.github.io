# What do you do when you're sick?

We've all been there. You get a cold, take some home remedies, sleep, and it goes away. Or you hurt yourself - ice, heat, rest ... all better, no doctor. You only go to the doctor when (1) you don't know what's going on, (2) the pain is too much to bear, or (3) someone who sees something you don't forces you to go. Either you or someone else must believe you are sick before making the effort to find and go to a doctor.

Let's talk about a different kind of sickness:

> 30 But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
>
> 31 Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. 32 I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”
>
> **Luke 5:30-32**

Jesus isn't talking about physical ailments - he's talking about a sickness of the soul. The "hidden" meaning behind what he is saying is that we are *all* sick, but we don't all call it what it is. There are two ways we deem ourselves "healthy":

- We compare our faults to others and figure that ours are not as bad as theirs, so we must be doing ok. The Pharisees, who Jesus was directly addressing in this passage, fell into this camp. Jesus deals with that again in Luke 18:9-14.
- We make up our own standard of right and wrong and thus are never really in any danger of any kind of moral shortcoming - at least nothing that we couldn't fix ourselves by just changing our minds about something.

Let's talk about that second one for a bit because it is especially true in our world today with moral relativism being the leading belief system. In other words, people believe morality is constructed by society to support our intrinsic common goal of survival and prosperity. That's why things that are wrong to one group of people are ok with another group. With such a belief system, no one is ever really "wrong", certainly not enough to seek out a true cure for the things that lead to our vices.

I wonder if people espousing this belief system have considered the implications of it. For instance, how many of us take anyone seriously when they claim to be a perfect human being? Under this belief system you would be forced to. How about rape - anyone think that's ever not wrong? Well with moral relativism I could argue that because sex is a pleasurable and somewhat chemically driven action, I should not have to abide by whatever society tells me is the "right" way to engage in it … because there is no absolute "right" way remember. You can morally justify rape and many other things under this belief system. It's rather absurd when you really think about all of its implications.

If I had to guess, I would say this idea that everyone can define good and evil for themselves is motivated by two things:
1. An unwillingness to call evil what it is out of a misguided attempt to be understanding or loving. 
2. An unwillingness to accept or even deal with the implications of there being an absolute moral standard of good and evil

I love my children immensely - consequently I regularly direct them towards what is right and away from what is wrong. Yeah, their feelings are going to get hurt, but if I do my job as a parent correctly, it will just be their feelings about not getting to do the thing they wanted to do. Their overall feeling about who they are as a person should not be damaged. Conflating those two ideas leads to motivation #1. It is certainly possible to call out evil in a loving way - in fact, the Bible commands it! 

Dealing with #2, what are those implications? Well, we would have to answer the question: where did we all get this notion of good and evil from? One possibility is that it was passed down to us genetically, but that doesn't answer how the first set of humans first obtained the knowledge of the distinction between good and evil. Perhaps it is a part of our natural evolutionary process? That doesn't make sense though because nature doesn't have morals to pass down through genetic structures. 

That pretty much leads us to one conclusion: it was given to us by some being that possessed the knowledge. In other words, to accept an absolute morality means you must accept that it was given to you by some being outside of this natural world. That is unacceptable to most people because they would rather not be held morally accountable to someone other than themselves, and/or they don't see any physical evidence for such a being existing (different topic).

Taking all of that into consideration, we can better appreciate what Jesus really means when he says he came for the sick. He's putting the responsibility on *us* to recognize our sickness and deal with it. If you think you're "healthy" as described above, Jesus' message will seem like complete foolishness to you. In fact, you might think the doctor's remedies don't really work because you see so many of his "patients" still exhibiting many of the characteristics that you and others do.

Listen, there are people who are more humble, patient, caring, serving, giving, kind, peaceful, temperate, empathetic - need I go on? - than me. Being a Christian doesn't mean I'm supposed to be better than all of them. There's no way I'll ever be the "best human being" on the planet. Being a Christian just means I figured out I'm sick. I went to the doctor and I'm doing what he tells me to so I can get well and one day be completely cured. I'm not cured yet so I'm going to continue to show signs of my sickness depending on how much or little of the prescribed medicine I take. Sometimes it tastes absolutely horrible. Sometimes I spit it up and yell at the doctor about why he's making me take this stuff - but in the end, I know I need to stomach it because it's going to keep me alive and eventually cure me once and for all.

Don't mistake what I'm talking about because I'm not trying to claim the Bible is the only answer people can find to live a happy, peaceful, fulfilling life. I don't believe that to be true and that's not what the Bible's message is. The message (in a very tiny nutshell) is that no matter how happy of a life we may have (i.e. no matter how "healthy" we think we are), there is still something inside all of us that makes us imperfect (sick). There is something broken on the inside because there is a standard of goodness that we did not invent which we have all fallen short of. This is referred to as "sin" in the Christian world. That's the sickness Jesus was referring to, the one he came to cure.
